#Synopsis

The project is about implementing few popular java collections:

* Array List
* Linked List
* Hash Set
* Hash Map

If you are interested in my approach to this problem, be invited to look at the source code and maybe
add something.

#Notice that these implementations purpose is just practice

#ENJOY :)
